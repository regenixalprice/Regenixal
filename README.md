<li class="" data-end="1370" data-start="1217">
<p class="" data-end="1370" data-start="1219"><strong data-end="1252" data-start="1219">Promotes Healthy Hair Growth:</strong> Regenixal provides essential nutrients that revitalize hair follicles, encouraging new growth and reducing hair fall.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="1526" data-start="1371">
<p class="" data-end="1526" data-start="1373"><strong data-end="1406" data-start="1373">Strengthens Hair from Within:</strong> By addressing the nutritional gaps that contribute to hair damage, it strengthens each strand from the root to the tip.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="1644" data-start="1527">
<p class="" data-end="1644" data-start="1529"><strong data-end="1565" data-start="1529">Improves Hair Texture and Shine:</strong> With regular use, many users report softer, shinier, and more manageable hair.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="1822" data-start="1645">
<p class="" data-end="1822" data-start="1647"><strong data-end="1673" data-start="1647">Supports Scalp Health:</strong> A healthy scalp is the foundation of strong hair. Regenixal contains ingredients that nourish and hydrate the scalp, reducing dryness and flakiness.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="1977" data-start="1823">
<p class="" data-end="1977" data-start="1825"><strong data-end="1861" data-start="1825">Reduces Breakage and Split Ends:</strong> With bioavailable collagen and keratin-building nutrients, the supplement enhances elasticity and reduces breakage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="" data-end="2011" data-start="1979"><strong data-end="2011" data-start="1983">What&rsquo;s Inside Regenixal?</strong></h3>
<p class="" data-end="2273" data-start="2013">Regenixal's potency lies in its <strong data-end="2081" data-start="2045">clean, clinically-backed formula</strong> that blends essential vitamins, minerals, and plant-based compounds. Every ingredient is carefully selected for its efficacy, bioavailability, and synergistic role in promoting hair wellness.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="2306" data-start="2275"><strong data-end="2306" data-start="2283">Biotin (Vitamin B7)</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="2575" data-start="2307">Biotin is a cornerstone nutrient for hair growth. It plays a vital role in the production of keratin &mdash; the protein that forms the structure of your hair, skin, and nails. A biotin-rich formula like Regenixal supports stronger, thicker strands and combats brittle hair.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="2609" data-start="2577"><strong data-end="2609" data-start="2585">Saw Palmetto Extract</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="2826" data-start="2610">This natural DHT-blocker helps reduce hair thinning and loss caused by hormonal imbalances. By inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to DHT (dihydrotestosterone), saw palmetto helps preserve hair follicle health.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="2859" data-start="2828"><strong data-end="2859" data-start="2836">Hydrolyzed Collagen</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="3073" data-start="2860">Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and a major component of hair structure. Regenixal uses hydrolyzed (easily absorbed) collagen to improve elasticity, strength, and shine from the inside out.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="3104" data-start="3075"><strong data-end="3104" data-start="3083">Zinc and Selenium</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="3290" data-start="3105">These trace minerals support hair follicle health and play a role in repairing damaged tissues. They also help regulate oil production on the scalp and protect against oxidative stress.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="3319" data-start="3292"><strong data-end="3319" data-start="3300">Hyaluronic Acid</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="3451" data-start="3320">Not just for skin &mdash; hyaluronic acid helps retain moisture in the scalp, improving the overall environment for healthy hair to grow.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="3484" data-start="3453"><strong data-end="3484" data-start="3461">Vitamin D3 and Iron</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="3685" data-start="3485">Both are essential for cellular renewal and healthy follicle function. Deficiencies in these nutrients are commonly linked to hair loss, which is why Regenixal ensures adequate levels in each capsule.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="3726" data-start="3687"><strong data-end="3726" data-start="3695">MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane)</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="3874" data-start="3727">MSM provides the sulfur needed to form keratin and collagen. It also supports circulation to the scalp, helping more nutrients reach the follicles.</p>
<h4 class="" data-end="3911" data-start="3876"><strong data-end="3911" data-start="3884">Amla and Bamboo Extract</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-end="4105" data-start="3912">Amla is a traditional Ayurvedic herb rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants. Bamboo extract, packed with silica, enhances the strength and elasticity of hair, giving it that coveted healthy bounce.</p>
<h3 class="" data-end="4140" data-start="4107"><strong data-end="4140" data-start="4111">Who Should Use Regenixal?</strong></h3>
<p class="" data-end="4281" data-start="4142">Regenixal is suitable for both <strong data-end="4190" data-start="4173">men and women</strong> looking to support their hair health at any stage of life. It's especially beneficial for:</p>
